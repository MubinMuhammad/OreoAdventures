## About
The game is written with C++ & OpenGL. It's a side-scrolling game like Super Mario, Flappy Bird, Terreria etc. Here the player is tasked to collect coins from the starting of the level and go through the door to enter the next level. The game is not polished and bugs are expected. It's just meant for my project list. And getting good at C++ & OpenGL.

## Building
If you use windows, I don't know what to do... Otherwise, you can run the makefile to build the project.
```bash
# At the root of my project run:
$ make
```
After building is successfully done (Hopefully). There will be an executable at the root of the project. Run it to play **test** the game. Thanks!
